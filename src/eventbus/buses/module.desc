/**
 * Provides several standard Eventbus instances that are accessible through named exports: `mainEventbus`,
 * `pluginEventbus`, and `testEventbus`. For the most part these instances are useful for testing applications to
 * have easy access across the runtime to consistent instances.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import { mainEventbus, pluginEventbus, testEventbus } from '@typhonjs-plugin/manager/eventbus/buses';
 * ```
 *
 * @module
